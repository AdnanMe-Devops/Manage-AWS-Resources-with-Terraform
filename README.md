# Manage-AWS-Resources-with-Terraform
Importing is useful for migrating existing resources to be managed by Terraform. Imported resources should be managed exclusively by Terraform and not modified outside of Terraform. For example, modifying the Web VPC in the AWS portal would create an inconsistency between the state stored by Terraform and the actual resource. Terraform will update the state whenever we use apply, detect the change, and modify the resource to bring it back to the desired state described in the configuration.
how to use interpolation syntax in a Terraform configuration file to reference resource attributes and implicitly create dependencies between resources. Also observed the dependency graph generated by the graph command.
WILL use input variables and built-in interpolation functions to create a pair of subnets in different availability zones, and a pair of instances in different subnets and will also used an output to make retrieving the IP addresses of the instances easy.  separated input and output variables into different files to organize the configuration.
